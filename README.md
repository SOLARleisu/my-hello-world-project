Github's advise: 

Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

Create a new branch with the mouse.

Edit the files by clicking the pencil icon.

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, youâ€™re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.
